# AGENTS Guidelines

This repository includes documentation and build scripts for an educational platform. The following rules help Codex keep the project consistent:

1. **Testing** – Always run `make help` before creating a pull request. Use the output to confirm the Makefile works.
2. **Documentation** – Keep docs in `docs/` and update the main `README.md` when global changes occur.
3. **No Secrets** – Never modify `.env.example` or commit actual credentials.
4. **Commits** – Keep commit messages concise in English.
